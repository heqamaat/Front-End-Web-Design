        <p>One of the most important steps to increase your chances of getting hired for a new job is to properly prepare for the job interview.  First you will want to research the company and the position you are applying for.  This will help you to understand the values, mission and goals of prospective employers. The company website is a great resource to start your investigation. You may also want to reach out to current or former employees through LinkedIn to gain their valuable insights on the company as well.</p>
        <p>Armed with this understanding of the company and position, your next step is to practice.  You should practice common interview questions or review resources such as mock interviews and lists of common interview questions. The interview is designed to evaluate your ability to handle a variety of situations on the job and you want to be prepared for any possible scenario that comes up. Finally, dress professionally and plan to arrive early to the interview.</p>
